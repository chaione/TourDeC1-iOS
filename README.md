Wayfinder
=============

A fun app to help you explore the ChaiONE office and win prizes!!

## Purpose

Finding your way around indoors can be difficult.  With the introduction of iBeacons, Apple has made wayfinding solutions much easier to build.  In this sample application, we used ContextHub to implement a Wayfinding app that leades our customer around the office.

## ContextHub

ContextHub takes care of all iBeacon monitoring and ranging, and lets you focus on building the screens and routing logic.  All you need to do is add the Beacon UUID on ContextHub, and the SDK will take care of the rest.
